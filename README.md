An implementation of Unit-Linking Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks (see [here](http://www.naturalspublishing.com/files/published/586ditw11466f5.pdf) for example)

## Requirements

    - Python 3.5 or greater
    - Python packages: numpy, imageio (for writing gif's), jupyter (if you want to look at the notebooks)
    - OpenCV 3.1.0

## Getting started

    Put the images you want run the pcnn on in the img subfolder and run main.py or check out the jupyter notebooks in the notebooks subfolder
